      question: "What is `useState` in React?",
      answer: "`useState` is a Hook in React that allows functional components to have state variables. It enables you to add state to functional components without converting them to class components."
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "How do you import `useState`?",
      answer: "You import `useState` from the 'react' package like this: `import React, { useState } from 'react';`."
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "How do you declare a state variable using `useState`?",
      answer: "You declare a state variable using array destructuring like this: `const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);`."
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "What is the initial state in `useState`?",
      answer: "The initial state is the value that the state variable is initialized with. It's passed as an argument to the `useState` function."
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "Can `useState` accept any data type as initial state?",
      answer: "Yes, `useState` can accept any JavaScript data type (primitive or object) as the initial state."
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: "How do you access the state variable returned by `useState`?",
      answer: "The state variable is typically accessed via the first element returned by `useState`, like `state` in `const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);`."
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      question: "What does the second element returned by `useState` represent?",
      answer: "The second element returned by `useState` is a function that allows you to update the state variable."
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: "How do you update the state using `useState`?",
      answer: "You update the state by calling the function returned by `useState`, passing the new state value as an argument. For example: `setState(newValue);`."
    },
    {
      id: 9,
      question: "Can you use `useState` multiple times in a single component?",
      answer: "Yes, you can call `useState` multiple times in a single component to manage different state variables independently."
    },
    {
      id: 10,
      question: "Does calling `useState` trigger a re-render of the component?",
      answer: "Yes, calling `useState` triggers a re-render of the component whenever the state is updated."
    },
    {
      id: 11,
      question: "Is the state variable mutable directly?",
      answer: "No, you should not mutate the state variable directly. Instead, you should always use the function returned by `useState` to update the state."
    },
    {
      id: 12,
      question: "Can you initialize the state with a function in `useState`?",
      answer: "Yes, you can initialize the state with a function. This is useful when the initial state value depends on the result of a function or a computation."
    },
    {
      id: 13,
      question: "Can you use `useState` inside conditional statements or loops?",
      answer: "No, `useState` must be called at the top level of your component, and it cannot be conditionally called."
    },
    {
      id: 14,
      question: "Can you use `useState` in React class components?",
      answer: "No, `useState` is specifically designed for functional components. In class components, you would use the `setState` method provided by the `Component` class."
    },
    {
      id: 15,
      question: "How do you handle complex state objects with `useState`?",
      answer: "You can handle complex state objects by passing an object as the initial state and then updating its properties individually using spread syntax or object destructuring. Alternatively, you can use multiple `useState` calls for different parts of the state."
